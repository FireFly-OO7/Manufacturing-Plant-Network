# Manufacturing-Plant-Network
Designing a scalable network for a manufacturing plant through Cisco Packet Tracer 

Imagine a cutting-edge manufacturing plant, where every unit — from Assembly and Quality Control to Logistics and Administration — operates in perfect synchrony. At the heart of this operation lies a robust, scalable network infrastructure, meticulously designed to ensure seamless communication between production lines and inventory systems.
The network is intelligently segmented using VLANs, creating secure communication channels that isolate IoT devices, SCADA systems, and enterprise networks, safeguarding sensitive operations from potential threats.
Real-time monitoring tools continuously oversee the entire infrastructure, detecting and responding to any network issues instantly — all without disrupting critical workflows.
This system isn’t just connected. It’s fortified — built with high availability and layered security, standing resilient against the growing wave of industrial cyber threats that target operational technology systems.
It is a network designed not just to perform, but to protect and endure.
